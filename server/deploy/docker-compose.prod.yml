# Nightjar Production Stack — night-jar.co

#
# Services:
#   1. nightjar-relay   — Public relay server (wss://night-jar.co/signal)
#   2. nightjar-private — Private instance with storage (night-jar.co/toot)
#
# Mailcow runs separately in /opt/mailcow-dockerized (ports 8080/8443).
# Nginx runs on the host and routes everything (see nginx.conf).
# The static landing page is served by nginx from /var/www/night-jar.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

  nightjar-private:
    # Re-uses the same image built by nightjar-relay — no second build needed.
    # Only the runtime BASE_PATH env var differs; Express prefixes routes and
    # strips it from incoming requests.  Vite's relative './' base resolves
    # correctly because the browser resolves ./assets/… relative to /toot/.
